Calculate perceptron using python. This can calculate multiple number of variables.
I was thought by 2 lecturers and both of them has different methods. So, this is the 2nd method. Still, I'm confuse. lol

# How To Run

## In Code Edit

1. Go to `perceptron_cal.py`.
2. Navigate to the bottom of the code until you find `__name__ == "__main__"` part.
3. Change the variable value.
4. Open cmd / terminal.
5. Run `python perceptron_cal.py`.

## Using Console Input

1. Open cmd / terminal.
2. Run `python main.py`.
3. Enter the value.

# What Different?

In this method, the desired output is denoted with `t` instead of `yd`. We also has bias `b` that need to be included in the calculation. There is only 1 type of activation function, so we don't need to care which activation function we need to use. The initial weight is always set to zero.

This method display more detail information which is the changes of the weight `Î”w`.
